Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <p>If you aren't already on your school's newspaper staff, chances are you'll need to try out to join the team. Most often, you'll need to submit several sample articles to prove that you have adequate writing and research skills. Check with the newspaper's staff supervisor to see what the process looks like for your school's newspaper.[2]
Check to see if there are deadlines for turning in mock articles, what the editor is looking for in a new staff member, and if there are any meetings you can attend to get more information.</p>

              <p>Once you're on the newspaper team, always check in with your editor to get specific assignments. If you have an idea for an article you'd like to write, pitch it to them and see if it's something you can get approval to work on.
If you've been on staff for a while, you may have the freedom to choose your own article topics. But until you know your position, it's always a good idea to ask for assignments.</p>

              <h3>Write a feature story to explore an in-depth issue or event.</h3>
              <p>Feature stories are generally 1000 words or more, and they focus on school policies, changes in the administration, national legislation that will affect the lives of students, and other big situations. When you write a feature story, focus on facts and research and include more background information than you would in other articles.[5]
Feature stories are the largest articles in a newspaper, and they often go beyond simple facts to the reasons behind something, like why an event happened and what it means for students moving forward.</p>

              <h3>Work on a news story to share information about events or policies. </h3>
              <p>A news story is generally a little shorter than a feature story, coming in at 750 to 1000 words. Write about information that students will find interesting or helpful, and focus on the facts of the story and offering multiple points of view about the situation. A news story should veer away from any personal feelings or opinions.[6]
News articles are generally more straightforward than feature stories or opinion articles. They convey relevant information in an unbiased way.</p>

              <p>Editorials are also called “opinion pieces,” and they don't include a byline, meaning that your name won't be signed to the article. These pieces won't be written in the singular first-person point of view, they're about 500 words long, and they provide commentary on topical, relevant issues.
For example, you could write an editorial about school rules, events or groups on campus, sports, programs, or teaching methods.</p>
